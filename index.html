                <h3>How much can I borrow from VicasonLoan? For how long?</h3>
                <p> For your first loan, you can borrow up to ₦10,000 for a period of up to 30 days. You decide how much
                    you want and how long you want it for. Once you have paid your first loan on time, the possibility
                    of you receiving a higher credit limit increases. The more times you take a SL loan and repay
                    successfully, the more we can lend to you.</p>

                <h3> How do I repay my loan?</h3>
                <p> We’ve made it as easy as possible for you to repay your VL loan. On your due date, your payment will
                    conveniently be deducted from the account linked to the debit/ATM card provided during your loan
                    application.</p>

                    VicasonLoan?</h3>
                <p>
                    Depending on your card type, you may need to enable your debit card for online transactions prior to
                    completing setup on VicasonLoan.

                <h3>I was approved for a loan, why have I not yet received my funds?</h3>
                <p>For your convenience, we’ll deduct your repayment automatically on your due date. Your debit/ATM card
                    needs to be setup in order for your funds to be disbursed to your account. Please click 'Setup Card'
                    in the app to add a card to be used for repayment.
                </p>
                <span> Please note: you may need to have at least NGN100 in the account linked to the card for setup to

                <h3>My loan status is ‘Disbursed’, but I am yet to receive funds in my account.</h3>
                <p>Funds are typically received within 72 hours of loan approval. Please let us know if you have not
                    received the transfer after that period. However, we also advise that you check your account balance
                    directly as credit alerts are not always received with transfers.</p>

                <h3> Why is my Bank Verification Number (BVN) required?</h3>
                <p>
                    We request your BVN as this is used to verify that the individual applying for a SmartLoan loan is
                    the same as the owner of the provided bank account. This is to ensure that your details cannot be
                    used to apply for a loan without your authorization in the event a 3rd party has access to your
                    account details. Please note: Your BVN does not provide access to your account. If in doubt, we
                    encourage you to confirm this from your bank before you proceed.

            <div>
                <h3> I don’t know my BVN. What do I do?</h3>
                <p> Just dial *565*0#. Please note: This will only work if you are making the request from the same
                    phone number currently linked to your bank account</p>
            </div>
            <section>
                <h3> What documents do I need to submit?</h3>
                <p>
                    You do not need to submit any documents to get a SmartLoan loan. We’ll just ask you for some basic
                    information so we can get to know you better. All you need is a compatible personal mobile device to
                    use the app and a functional BVN-linked bank account to receive funds in, and a valid debit/ATM card
                    for loan repayment.

            <div>
                <h3> Can I make an early repayment? If I make an early repayment, will I pay less?</h3>
                <p>Early repayments are accepted and you can apply for a new loan immediately your previous loan is paid
                    off. However, please note that early repayment does not imply that the terms of your loan obligation
                    will change. Your repayment terms are fixed at the point of loan application and the total amount to
                    be paid is not changed by an early repayment.
